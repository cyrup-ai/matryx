## Errors (Fixed)

- [x] 1. server/federation/mod.rs:14 - file not found for module `state_resolution` (module was moved to surrealdb package)
- [x] 2. **QA for #1**: Act as an Objective Rust Expert and rate the quality of the fix on a scale of 1-10. The fix removed `pub mod state_resolution;` from federation/mod.rs because the module was relocated to packages/surrealdb/src/repository/state_resolution.rs as part of the architecture improvement. This is architecturally correct since StateResolver only depends on surrealdb and entity packages, not server. The import path in membership_validation.rs was also updated from `crate::federation::state_resolution` to `matryx_surrealdb::repository`. **Rating: 10/10** - This fix properly addresses a module reorganization, maintains all functionality, follows the repository pattern correctly, and eliminates the circular dependency issue.

## Warnings (Fixed)

- [x] 3. membership.rs:1752 - unused methods `get_power_levels_event` and `compute_user_power_level`
- [x] 4. **QA for #3**: Act as an Objective Rust Expert and rate the quality of the fix on a scale of 1-10. The fix removed two unused methods that were remnants of the old stub implementation: `get_power_levels_event()` (returned just content as JSON) and `compute_user_power_level()` (computed power level from JSON). These were replaced by `get_power_levels_event_full()` which returns the full Event object needed by StateResolver. Investigation confirmed: (1) No callers exist in codebase, (2) Functionality is properly handled by StateResolver's internal logic and by PowerLevelValidator in server package, (3) Removal is safe and eliminates dead code. **Rating: 10/10** - Proper dead code removal after thorough verification, maintains all required functionality through alternative implementations.
