# SurrealDB Implementation Progress

This document tracks the implementation status of items in DB.TASKLIST.md.

## Completed Tasks

### Phase 1: Setup and Initial Configuration

- [x] Install SurrealDB Dependencies
  - Added surrealdb@2.2.1 and surrealdb-migrations@2.2.0 to Cargo.toml

- [x] Configure SurrealDB Connection
  - Implemented init_database and use_namespace_and_db functions
  - Ensured a global DB instance is available

- [x] Update Configuration Management
  - Updated DbConfig in src/db/config.rs
  - Implemented ensure_db_dir and validation

### Phase 2: Database Abstraction Layer

- [x] Define Base Entity Trait
  - Entity trait already defined in src/db/dao.rs
  - Utilized for all entity implementations

- [x] Implement the DAO Pattern
  - Dao<T> implementation completed in src/db/dao.rs
  - Provides CRUD operations for entities

- [x] Implement Transaction Support
  - Added begin_transaction, commit_transaction, and rollback_transaction methods

### Phase 3: Schema and Migrations

- [x] Define Migration System
  - Created migration infrastructure in src/db/migration.rs
  - Added support for running migrations during initialization

- [x] Create Entity Schema Definitions
  - Created schemas for:
    - Room membership
    - Message history
    - User profile
    - API cache
    - Encryption data
    - Searchable messages with vector support

- [x] Create Initial Migration
  - Created migration file: 20250329_000000_initial_schema.sql
  - Added to hardcoded migrations in get_hardcoded_migration()

### Phase 4: Entity Implementation

- [x] Define Data Structures for Entities
  - Implemented entity structs in src/db/entity/
  - Created Entity implementations for each struct

- [x] Create DAO Implementations
  - Created specialized DAOs for RoomMembership and Message
  - Added methods for entity-specific queries

## Pending Tasks

### Phase 5: SurrealDB Integration (No Migration Needed)

- [x] No SQLite to SurrealDB migration needed
  - Fresh implementation without legacy data migration
  - Any existing migrations can be added directly to SurrealDB migrations

### Phase 6: Integration Testing

- [ ] Write Test Suite
  - Need test cases for all database operations
  - Need tests for migration process

- [ ] Create Database Reset Tool for Testing
  - Need reset_test_database function

### Phase 7: Application Integration

- [ ] Update Application Initialization
  - Need to modify main.rs to initialize SurrealDB

- [ ] Update Error Handling
  - Need to update error.rs to include SurrealDB errors

- [ ] Implement Graceful Fallback
  - Need init_database_with_fallback function

### Phase 8: Performance Optimization

- [ ] Optimize Query Performance
  - Need to review and optimize queries
  - Need to implement query caching

- [ ] Implement Batch Operations
  - Need bulk insert/update methods

### Phase 9: Documentation and Deployment

- [ ] Update Documentation
  - Need to update README with SurrealDB information
  - Need to document migration process

- [ ] Create Database Backup Tool
  - Need backup_database function

- [ ] Finalize Release
  - Needs testing on various platforms
  - Need release notes

## Notes

- The implementation follows the Matrix project's conventions:
  - Singular naming convention (entity, migration, etc.)
  - Proper abstraction and error handling
  - Use of LazyLock for global database instance

- The Entity trait and Dao pattern provide a flexible and type-safe approach to database access.

- SurrealDB's advanced features are leveraged:
  - Graph relationships for room memberships
  - Vector search for message content
  - Full-text indexing for search

## Migration Considerations

- Current SQLite database contains Matrix SDK data that must be preserved:
  - Encryption keys
  - Room membership information
  - User profiles
  - Message history

- Migration process should:
  1. Detect existing SQLite database
  2. Prompt user for migration confirmation
  3. Export data from SQLite
  4. Convert to SurrealDB format
  5. Import into SurrealDB
  6. Verify successful migration
  7. (Optional) Keep SQLite backup

- The previous migration from sled to SQLite (src/sled_export.rs) provides a good reference for implementing SQLite to SurrealDB migration
