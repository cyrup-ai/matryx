# Stub Implementations Found and Removed

## Removed Stub Files

### 1. `/packages/server/src/_matrix/client/v3/account/threepid/email/request_token.rs`
- **Status**: REMOVED
- **Reason**: Was a stub implementation with hardcoded example response
- **Proper Implementation**: Already exists in `threepid_3pid.rs` with full SMTP integration
- **Router Status**: Router correctly points to proper implementation

```rust
// STUB THAT WAS REMOVED:
pub async fn post(Json(_payload): Json<Value>) -> Result<Json<Value>, StatusCode> {
    Ok(Json(json!({
        "sid": "example_session_id",
        "submit_url": "https://example.com/submit_token"
    })))
}
```

### 2. `/packages/server/src/_matrix/client/v3/account/threepid/msisdn/request_token.rs`
- **Status**: REMOVED  
- **Reason**: Was a stub implementation with hardcoded example response
- **Proper Implementation**: Already exists in `threepid_3pid.rs` with full Twilio SMS integration
- **Router Status**: Router correctly points to proper implementation

```rust
// STUB THAT WAS REMOVED:
pub async fn post(Json(_payload): Json<Value>) -> Result<Json<Value>, StatusCode> {
    Ok(Json(json!({
        "sid": "example_session_id", 
        "submit_url": "https://example.com/submit_token"
    })))
}
```

## Remaining Stubs to Implement

### Matrix API Endpoints with Stub-like Implementations

*To be cataloged by examining warning output and identifying minimal/placeholder implementations*

## Notes
- The threepid stubs were correctly removed because proper implementations already existed
- Need to identify other stub implementations that should be replaced with proper code
- Focus should be on Matrix protocol compliance and production-quality implementations
