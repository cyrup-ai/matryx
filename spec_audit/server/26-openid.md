# Matrix Server-Server API: OpenID

*Federation protocol specification for OpenID token exchange in Matrix.*

---

## Overview

OpenID enables third-party services to verify user identity by exchanging access tokens for user information. This specification defines the federation endpoint for OpenID token validation.

---

## OpenID

Third-party services can exchange an access token previously generated by the Client-Server API for information about a user. This can help verify that a user is who they say they are without granting full access to the user's account.

Access tokens generated by the OpenID API are only good for the OpenID API and nothing else.
