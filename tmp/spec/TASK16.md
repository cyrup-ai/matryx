# TASK 16: Push Notification System

## OBJECTIVE
Implement comprehensive push notification system with complete push rule engine, pusher management, and push gateway communication.

## SUBTASKS

### SUBTASK1: Complete Push Rule Engine
- **What**: Implement comprehensive push rule engine with all Matrix push rules
- **Where**: `packages/server/src/_matrix/client/v3/pushrules/` (enhance existing)
- **Why**: Provide flexible notification control for Matrix users

### SUBTASK2: Predefined Push Rules
- **What**: Add all predefined push rules (.m.rule.*)
- **Where**: `packages/server/src/push/predefined_rules.rs` (create)
- **Why**: Implement standard Matrix push rule set

### SUBTASK3: Push Rule Conditions and Actions
- **What**: Implement push rule conditions and actions system
- **Where**: `packages/server/src/push/conditions.rs` and `packages/server/src/push/actions.rs` (create)
- **Why**: Enable complex notification logic based on message content and context

### SUBTASK4: Pusher Management
- **What**: Add comprehensive pusher management (add, remove, modify)
- **Where**: `packages/server/src/_matrix/client/v3/pushers/` (enhance existing)
- **Why**: Allow users to manage their notification endpoints

### SUBTASK5: Push Gateway Communication
- **What**: Implement push gateway communication and delivery
- **Where**: `packages/server/src/push/gateway.rs` (create)
- **Why**: Deliver notifications through external push services
