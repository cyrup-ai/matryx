# TASK 21: Database Schema Completion

## OBJECTIVE
Complete the SurrealDB schema implementation with comprehensive event storage, device management, push notifications, and search indexing.

## SUBTASKS

### SUBTASK1: Complete Event Storage Schema
- **What**: Implement comprehensive event storage schema with relationships
- **Where**: `packages/surrealdb/migrations/` (enhance existing schema)
- **Why**: Ensure all Matrix events are properly stored with efficient querying

### SUBTASK2: Device and Key Storage Tables
- **What**: Add device registration and key storage tables
- **Where**: `packages/surrealdb/migrations/` (add to existing schema)
- **Why**: Support E2EE device management and key storage requirements

### SUBTASK3: Push Notification Storage
- **What**: Implement push rule and pusher storage tables
- **Where**: `packages/surrealdb/migrations/` (add to existing schema)
- **Why**: Store push notification configuration and delivery state

### SUBTASK4: Account Data and Media Storage
- **What**: Add account data and media metadata storage
- **Where**: `packages/surrealdb/migrations/` (add to existing schema)
- **Why**: Support user preferences and media management

### SUBTASK5: Search Index and Federation Tables
- **What**: Implement search index and federation transaction storage
- **Where**: `packages/surrealdb/migrations/` (add to existing schema)
- **Why**: Enable full-text search and reliable federation

## DEFINITION OF DONE
- Event storage schema supports all Matrix event types
- Device and key tables functional for E2EE
- Push notification storage operational
- Account data and media tables working
- Search and federation tables implemented
- Clean compilation with `cargo fmt && cargo check`
