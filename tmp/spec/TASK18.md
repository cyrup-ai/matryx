# TASK 18: Event Replacements and Reactions

## OBJECTIVE
Implement message editing (event replacements) and reaction system to enable modern messaging features including edit history and emoji reactions.

## SUBTASKS

### SUBTASK1: Message Replacement System
- **What**: Implement message replacement system using m.replace
- **Where**: `packages/server/src/events/replacements.rs` (create)
- **Why**: Enable users to edit previously sent messages
