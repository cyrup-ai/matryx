# TASK 11: Real-time Communication Features

## OBJECTIVE
Implement real-time communication features including typing notifications, read receipts, presence system, and their integration with the sync API.

## SUBTASKS

### SUBTASK1: Typing Notifications System
- **What**: Implement typing indicator APIs with real-time distribution
- **Where**: `packages/server/src/_matrix/client/v3/rooms/*/typing/` (create)
- **Why**: Provide real-time typing awareness for better user experience

### SUBTASK2: Read Receipts Implementation
- **What**: Implement comprehensive read receipt system (m.receipt)
- **Where**: `packages/server/src/_matrix/client/v3/rooms/*/receipt/` (create)
- **Why**: Track message read status across users and devices

### SUBTASK3: Read Markers System
- **What**: Add read markers (m.fully_read, m.marked_unread)
- **Where**: `packages/server/src/_matrix/client/v3/rooms/*/read_markers/` (create)
- **Why**: Provide user-controlled read status management

### SUBTASK4: Presence System
- **What**: Implement presence status management (online, offline, unavailable)
- **Where**: `packages/server/src/_matrix/client/v3/presence/` (create)
- **Why**: Show user availability status across the Matrix network

### SUBTASK5: Real-time Integration
- **What**: Integrate all real-time features with sync API and LiveQuery
- **Where**: `packages/server/src/realtime/` (create module)
- **Why**: Ensure real-time features work through Matrix sync mechanism

## DEFINITION OF DONE
- Typing notifications working with timeout handling
- Read receipts functional including private receipts
- Read markers operational for user read status
- Presence system working with status updates
- All features integrated with sync API
- Clean compilation with `cargo fmt && cargo check`

## RESEARCH NOTES
- Matrix typing notification specification
- Read receipt format and behavior
- Presence system requirements
- Real-time event distribution patterns

## REQUIRED DOCUMENTATION
- Matrix typing notification specification
- Read receipt specification
- Presence system documentation
- Real-time event integration guidelines
