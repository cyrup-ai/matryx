# TASK 6: Advanced Room Creation and Management

## OBJECTIVE
Enhance room creation capabilities with version selection, preset configurations, initial state validation, and power level management.

## SUBTASKS

### SUBTASK1: Room Version Selection
- **What**: Implement room version selection and validation during creation
- **Where**: `packages/server/src/_matrix/client/v3/create_room.rs` (enhance existing)
- **Why**: Support different Matrix room versions with proper validation

### SUBTASK2: Preset Configurations
- **What**: Add preset configurations (private_chat, public_chat, trusted_private_chat)
- **Where**: `packages/server/src/room/presets.rs` (create)
- **Why**: Simplify room creation with predefined settings

### SUBTASK3: Initial State Event Validation
- **What**: Implement initial state event validation during room creation
- **Where**: `packages/server/src/room/initial_state.rs` (create)
- **Why**: Ensure valid room state from creation

### SUBTASK4: Room Alias Creation Integration
- **What**: Add room alias creation during room creation process
- **Where**: `packages/server/src/room/alias_creation.rs` (create)
- **Why**: Enable automatic alias assignment during room setup

### SUBTASK5: Power Level Configuration Templates
- **What**: Implement power level configuration templates
- **Where**: `packages/server/src/room/power_levels.rs` (create)
- **Why**: Provide standard power level configurations for different room types

## DEFINITION OF DONE
- Room version selection working with validation
