# VERIFY Task 08: Tables 113-128 - Code Quality Cleanup

## QA Rating: 9/10

**Status:** One minor code quality issue remaining
**Priority:** P3 (Code quality improvement)

---

## Executive Summary

All 16 tables (113-128) exist and are functional. All required schema improvements have been implemented successfully:

✅ **COMPLETED:**
- Table 114: pdus/edus fields correctly typed as `array<object>`
- Table 116: UNIQUE constraint added to tm_user_txn_idx index
- Table 117: state_resolution field has ASSERT validation
- Table 122: expires_at field changed to datetime type with validation
- User relationships: Placeholder method `subscribe_to_presence_with_friends` removed (Approach A)

⚠️ **REMAINING ISSUE:**
- Table 124: Redundant field definition needs removal

**Compilation Status:** ✅ `cargo check -p matryx_surrealdb` passes with exit code 0

## Outstanding Issue

### Table 124: Remove Redundant Field Definition

**File:** `/Volumes/samsung_t9/maxtryx/packages/surrealdb/migrations/tables/124_registration_token.surql`

**Problem:** Duplicate `uses_remaining` field definition

**Current Code (Lines 16-31):**
```sql
DEFINE FIELD uses_allowed ON TABLE registration_token TYPE option<int>;

DEFINE FIELD uses_remaining ON TABLE registration_token TYPE option<int>;  ← DELETE THIS LINE

DEFINE FIELD pending ON TABLE registration_token TYPE bool DEFAULT false;

DEFINE FIELD completed ON TABLE registration_token TYPE bool DEFAULT false;

-- Ensure uses_remaining never exceeds uses_allowed
DEFINE FIELD uses_remaining ON TABLE registration_token TYPE option<int>
    ASSERT 
        $value IS NONE 
        OR $parent.uses_allowed IS NONE 
        OR $value <= $parent.uses_allowed;

-- Clarify state machine: token cannot be both pending and completed
-- Note: pending = registration in progress, completed = registration finished
-- A token can be neither (unused), pending (in use), or completed (consumed)
```

**Action Required:**
1. Delete line 18: `DEFINE FIELD uses_remaining ON TABLE registration_token TYPE option<int>;`
2. Keep the complete definition at lines 26-31 (with ASSERT constraint)

**Rationale:**
- Line 18 is redundant - it's overridden by the complete definition at line 26
- Violates DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
- Could cause confusion for future maintainers
- While SurrealDB allows this (later definition wins), it's poor code quality

**Verification:**
After fix, run: `cargo check -p matryx_surrealdb` (should still pass)

---

## Definition of Done

Task is complete when:

1. ✅ Line 18 of `124_registration_token.surql` is deleted
2. ✅ `cargo check -p matryx_surrealdb` exits with code 0
3. ✅ No redundant field definitions remain in the schema

**Estimated Effort:** < 1 minute

## Context

This task verified schema quality improvements for tables 113-128. All functional requirements are complete. This final cleanup addresses a code quality issue discovered during review.
